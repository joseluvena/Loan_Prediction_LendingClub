# Loan_Prediction_LendingClub
This repository displays my team's codes and results for a full analysis on Lending Club's loan dataset.
The objective of this analysis is to:
Part A: Clean data, identify leakage varaibles
Part B: Build Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting algorithms, Logistic regression, kNN, Naive Bayes (Classification Models)
Assigment 2: Regression models to predict expected payoff of these loans.
